Dear Manager,
	
  Our team would like to propose a project to you that we have recently been formulating. Using data from the __National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79)__, 
we are looking to find predictive factors that indicate the income level people will reach in their life. This NLSY79 data was collected starting back in 1979 
with a group of over __12,000__ Americans between the ages of 14 and 22. Since then, they have surveyed this same group of people regarding topics such as their 
family background, education, and income. Although many people were dropped from the survey over the last 40 years, there are still almost __10,000__ participants 
in 2021. 
  
  At this point, we would specifically like to investigate childhood indicators relevant to both their education and personal life. We believe features such as 
* highest grade completed
* test scores
* family size
* poverty level

can give a holistic view of income predictors. We will be looking to determine whether or not these are indicators of income level, and what the correlation 
between them is. While the data does offer various different types of income, we will be focusing specifically on income from a business/occupation, ignoring 
income such as unemployment, child support, or inheritance, as these would likely display very different outcomes than job-related income. We are also suspecting 
that due to the nature and longevity of the study, there will be significant missing data. For the data we find most relevant, we will need to assess the 
significance of the missing values and clean up the data before starting on the analysis.
  
  If we are able to successfully model future income level based on predictors from a person’s early life, this information could be used either by parents and 
educators hoping to set children up for success, or for young adults hoping guidance on how to improve themselves for the future. This would be valuable 
information that could be sold for personal development purposes. Many schools could benefit from this information by using it to target students who might need 
extra help or attention that are lacking in some of the key indicators.
  
  Due to the large amount of data we have at our disposal related to the study’s participant’s lives, we are confident that we will be able to find indicators of 
a future income, and use them to come up with a solid model. Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions so we can go forward with this project.
