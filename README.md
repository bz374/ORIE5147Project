# Income Level Predictions based on National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

## Project Description
In this project, we are looking to find predictive factors that indicate the income level people will reach in their life. We base our model on data from the __National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79)__, which was collected starting back in 1979 with a group of over 12,000 Americans between the of ages 14 and 22.
